WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE BROKERAGE REPOSITORY
******************************************

Glad to have you here! People is working to create an open-source retail brokerage. After what we saw on January 28th with many retail brokerages halting and limiting the buy orders on stocks like GME AMC & NOK, we took it upon ourselves to create a brokerage by the People, for the People. We pride ourselves on being decentralized and transparent.

Decentralized: No ties to Wall Street investment firms. We've seen how manipulative these folks are toward retail traders and we're not for it one bit.
Transparent: We promise to be as transparent as possible, not hiding behind fancy legal business jargon and making excuses for ourselves. If we mess up, we'll let you know quick!


That's just who we are though, here's what we plan to offer:
  
  * BTC / stock exchange, the ability to trade stocks for Bitcoin instead of just plain cash.
  * Commission FREE! We're tired of paying comissions on outdated brokerages. This includes stock trading, options trading, and cryptocurrency trading.
  * Social Media / forum, we'd like to create a forum (similar to that of Stocktwits) where people can share their investment ideas. Text, pictures, even videos.

Of course, if you have any other ideas in terms of functionality let us know! We're all ears in trying to give the People the brokerage that they actually want.

Here are some handy resources:
