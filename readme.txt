WELCOME TO OUR BROKERAGE IDEA REPOSITORY!!
******************************************

Glad to have you here. We're working on creating an ideal brokerage that caters to all types of traders, this will help the redundancy of having multiple brokerages like many currently have. Some use Robinhood because of its simple UI but Robinhood lacks many technical analysis tool, like Thinkorswim. We want to create a brokerage that is both beautiful and functional! We also want to create a brokerage that is quick, no slow executions here only lightning speed to get our users the best fills possible on market orders.

On top of that, here's a few of the functions we're looking to include:
  
  * BTC / stock exchange, the ability to trade stocks for Bitcoin instead of just plain cash
  * Commission FREE! We're tired of paying comissions on outdated brokerages
  * Social Media / forum, we'd like to create a forum (similar to that of Stocktwits) where people can share their investment ideas

Of course, if you have any other ideas in terms of functionality let us know! We're all ears in trying to give the people the brokerage that they actually want.

Here are some handy resources:
